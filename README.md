###Parent Child Data Modeling Workshop Part 2

Congratulations!

Takeaways:
1.	You understand the value and importance of documenting your site build before implementing anything in Drupal.  
2.	You understand where being a “unique” developer and implementing other site build methods away from “the Drupal Way” offers powerful and cost effective benefits.  
3.	You understand that adjusting Drupal’s UIs creates a more true to life content maintenance experience.  
4.	You understand that adding functionality to a pre-existing system is not difficult.  
5.	You understand that Views is your absolute “Best Drupal Friend” in the world. To maintain that friendship requires knowing the intended result, knowing your information architecture and an elementary knowledge of database relationships.  
6.	You understand that Drupal entities can easily replace Taxonomy which removes query overhead and offers speed performance increases.  
7.	You understand that management displays are essential and using the dashboard offers a custom solution that can be tailored to any client.  
8.	You understand that staying as close to Drupal core and not resorting to stacking modules onto a system makes perfect sense and you will strive to continue that approach.  
9.	You understand the value of our community and how contributing back is what makes our community one of the most vibrant in the developer world.  
10.	You understand that you grew in leaps and bounds in an extremely short period of time with this workshop. Share your knowledge with others… it’s the right thing to do.  



###A personal thank you from Jay:

I want to thank all of you that attended part 1, part 2 or both of the PCDM workshops. I hope these methods will bring you success through your Drupal careers and that you will share your journeys with others at local meet up groups, on drupal.org or any other ways you see fit to contribute back to your community.

By completing this workshop, you now have a firm grasp on the more intricate details of site building to an advanced level and how those intricacies when dealt with properly, can enhance the solutions you provide as well as enhance the user experience of those who will use the solutions you provide.

In closing, to all my new Drupal friends, thank you… and by the way… you guys ROCK!
